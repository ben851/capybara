        Are capybaras good pets?
        </h2>
        Although mostly adorable and sweet, capybaras can be a challenging pet. They do better in groups as they are extremely social animals, so pet owners should avoid getting a single capybara. This semi-aquatic rodent is legal to own in Texas and Pennsylvania. In some states they are legal but require licenses.
        <h2>
        Do capybaras eat their own poop?
        </h2>
        The capybara is basically a giant guinea pig that can grow to up to 140 pounds on a diet of grass — and its own poop. ...

        <h2>
        Do capybaras smell?
        </h2>
        Capybara fur doesn't smell because they don't have a thick undercoat like a dog or a cat. ... They do have a scent gland on their nose that they rub on stuff but apparently people can't smell that</p>
