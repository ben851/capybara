<H2>How It Gets Food</H2>
<P>The Capybara is a herbivorous animal that only eats plant matter in order to acquire all of the nutrients it needs. The diet of the Capybara is mainly made up of grasses and aquatic plants, along with fruits and berries and the occasional munch on soft tree bark.</P>
<H2>Protection From Predators</H2>
<P>A constant source of water is important to capybaras, who retreat into murky waters to escape from predators like jaguars, anacondas, caimans, pumas, ocelots, and harpy eagles. Capybaras are physically well-adapted to a semi-aquatic lifestyle.</P>
<H2>leeping Habits</H2>
<P>As crepuscular animals, capybaras are most active during dawn or dusk. Sometimes, though, when capybaras feel threatened they will be nocturnal, which means they will stay awake at night and sleep during the day. The dark provides them cover while they eat and socialize so that predators are less likely to attack them.</P>
