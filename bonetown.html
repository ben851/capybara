<h1>Mating and Reproduction</h1>
<p>Capybaras are very social creatures. They live in herds of up to twenty members, with a dominant male, several females and their young, and some submissive males. Only the dominant male may breed with the females. Capybaras will rarely accept a stranger into their herd.</p>
<p>Capybaras reproduce once a year, if the conditions are right. While they don't require violins and a candlelit dinner, they do need a rainy season, preferably April or May. They become sexually mature at around eighteen months. The male detects when the female is ready to mate by her scent and then they breed in the water.</p>
<p>The gestation period of the capybara is about one hundred and fifty days. Two to eight pups are born, weighing two to four pounds each. The female leaves the herd to give birth somewhere private, then returns, to be followed by the pups three or four days later, when they learn how to walk.</p>
<p>Capybara pups drink Mom's milk until they are around four months old, but they can also eat grass after about a week. All of the females in the herd share the responsibility of providing milk for the pups.</p>
